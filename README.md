Daily Trips: How often do Americans Leave Home? 

By: Trevor McCormick

Most people in America leave their houses on a regular basis, but some do so at a much higher or lower rate than others. The Department of Transportation has recorded data on how often people leave their homes daily in each state. The goal of this project was to see if machine learning can be used to predict how often people will leave their homes in the future on a given date. In this project I will be using various applications such as Python (with packages), SQLite, and Power BI to do my analysis, visualization, and testing.
